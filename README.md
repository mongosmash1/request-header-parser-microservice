<b>Objective:</b> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to <a href="https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/whoami/">this</a> and deploy it to Glitch.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit <a href="https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects">this</a>.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

<b>User Story:</b> I can get the IP address, language and operating system for my browser.
